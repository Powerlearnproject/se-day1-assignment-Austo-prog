List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Gathering and Analysis:

In this phase, the requirements of the software are collected from stakeholders (e.g., clients, users). These requirements are then analyzed to understand the project scope and to ensure clear communication of expectations. The goal is to define what the software will do.
System Design:

Once requirements are clear, the system design phase begins. The software architecture, user interfaces, database design, and other technical specifications are planned. This phase aims to translate requirements into a design blueprint that developers can follow.
Implementation (Coding):

In this phase, developers write the actual code for the application based on the design documents. This is typically the longest phase in the SDLC. Developers follow coding standards and ensure that the code is maintainable and well-documented.
Testing:

After coding, the software goes through various types of testing (e.g., unit, integration, system, user acceptance testing) to find and fix bugs. The goal is to ensure the software works as expected and meets the requirements specified in the first phase.
Deployment:

Once the software passes testing, it is deployed to the production environment. This may be done in stages, with a beta release or full rollout. Deployment often involves monitoring the software's performance and ensuring its stability in a live environment.
Maintenance:

After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is monitored for issues such as bugs, performance problems, or security vulnerabilities. Updates, patches, and enhancements may be made to improve functionality or address new user needs over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
- there is Low flexibility,
 changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
 - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
 - Testing is done at the end of the development process.


agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
 - reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
 - create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
 - confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 
- analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
- develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.
 - discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
 - create blueprint for the project.
 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
 - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
importance:
Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.
An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. - Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling, in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application.
Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git
importance:
Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
-Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
 Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 
-Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
 Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance:
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language modelsâ€™ training data.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used by software developers to design, develop, test, and deploy software applications. It typically consists of the following phases:

Requirement Gathering and Analysis:

In this phase, the requirements of the software are collected from stakeholders (e.g., clients, users). These requirements are then analyzed to understand the project scope and to ensure clear communication of expectations. The goal is to define what the software will do.
System Design:

Once requirements are clear, the system design phase begins. The software architecture, user interfaces, database design, and other technical specifications are planned. This phase aims to translate requirements into a design blueprint that developers can follow.
Implementation (Coding):

In this phase, developers write the actual code for the application based on the design documents. This is typically the longest phase in the SDLC. Developers follow coding standards and ensure that the code is maintainable and well-documented.

Deployment:

Once the software passes testing, it is deployed to the production environment. This may be done in stages, with a beta release or full rollout. Deployment often involves monitoring the software's performance and ensuring its stability in a live environment.
Maintenance:

After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is monitored for issues such as bugs, performance problems, or security vulnerabilities. Updates, patches, and enhancements may be made to improve functionality or address new user needs over time.
These phases help ensure the software is delivered on time, within budget, and meets the required quality standards.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective
Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about the benefits of a website."

Improved Prompt:
"Explain three key benefits of having a responsive website for a small business, focusing on user experience, SEO, and conversion rates."

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
Clear and Specific Focus: The improved prompt specifies that the benefits should be related to a "responsive website" and "small businesses," narrowing down the scope.
Targets Key Areas: It directs the answer to cover specific aspects (user experience, SEO, and conversion rates), making the response more relevant and comprehensive.
Concise and Actionable: By focusing on three key benefits and naming exact aspects to discuss, the improved prompt makes it easier to structure a concise and actionable response.
